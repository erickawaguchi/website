According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Thus it imperative that to both understand the etiology of cancer as well as discover life-saving therapeutics for the disease. Statisticians are critical in the design on clinical trials and the analysis and interpretation of data pertaining to cancer and cancer-related outcomes.

As a graduate student at UCLA, I have also worked on several collaborative projects with members of the Jonsson Cancer Comprehensive Center (JCCC). My responsibilities included statistical consulting, data analysis, sample size/power calculations, and the writing of statistical analysis plans and protocols. My work has resulted in a Nature Medicine publication and the funding of several NIH R01 grants.

At USC, I have provided assistance to the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP). My responsibilities include statistical consulting and data analysis as well as providing guest lectures in the analysis of time-to-event (survival) data.
