At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in patients with pneumonia of unclear etiology in Wuhan, China. The disease was termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, and the underlying viral agent was subsequently termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Needless to say, COVD19 has dramatically impacted people all around the world.

I was initially part of a study that aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at USC. This work was recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. Since then, I have been working with both the Department of Preventive Medicine and the Engemann Student Health Center as a member of the DPM Pandemic Center.
