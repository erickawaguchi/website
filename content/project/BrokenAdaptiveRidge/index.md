My dissertation revolved around the development and application of a new regularization technique known as Broken Adaptive Ridge (BAR) regression. In short, BAR was a scalable approximation to $\ell_0$ regularization based on iterative reweighted $\ell_2$ regularization. We extended this approach to generalized linear models (GLM) and time-to-event data (Right-censored and competing risks) and guaranteed its theoretical properties under these settings.
