Survival analysis is a branch of statistics focusing on the analysis of data with a time-to-event endpoint. This subfield is also called reliability theory or reliability analysis (engineering), duration analysis or duration modeling (economics), and event history analysis (sociology).

The majority of my career (both methodological and collaborative) has been focused in this area.
