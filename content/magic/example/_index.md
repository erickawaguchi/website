## What is Grixis Death's Shadow?
Grixis Death's Shadow (GDS for short) is classically a black-blue-red tempo deck.

## What is a tempo deck?

According to Wikipedia:

> In chess and other chess-like games, a tempo is a "turn" or single move. When a player achieves a desired result in one fewer move, the player is said to "gain a tempo"; conversely, when a player takes one more move than necessary, the player is said to "lose a tempo". Similarly, when a player forces their opponent to make moves not according to their initial plan, one is said to "gain tempo" because the opponent is wasting moves. A move that gains a tempo is often called "a move with tempo".

In Magic, Tempo decks are decks whose strategy centers around timing and mana advantage and usually win the game by using an undercosted threat that is protected throughout the game. 

Tempo decks are always responding to the development of the board and require cards that are versatile and relevant to the board state in all stages of the game. Thus, these decks rely heavily on low-costed conditional cards.

Timing is everything for tempo decks and thus makes it one of the most difficult deck archetypes to play/master. 

Most of the key cards in GDS cost one mana or effectively cost one mana allowing you to play multiple spells per turn.

## Deck List

### Mana Base:
The mana base for GDS is pretty much set. Traditionally, GDS is a blue-black deck that splashes red for certain spells like Lightning Bolt, Temur Battle Rage, and Kolaghan's Command. GDS is a deck all about mana efficiency and therefore we mostly require blue/black mana in general. 

We also need to efficiently lose life and lose life on our own terms. Fortunately, the modern mana base allows us to almost lose 1, 2, or 3 life on demand.  



The fetch + shock combo is important for us since it allows us to enable (and grow) our Death's Shadow. We can also control the amount of damage we want to inflict upon ourselves by fetching either a shock or a basic land. Many players will even opt to fetch + shock on turn one without having a play to reduce their life total quickly. 




```
4x Polluted Delta
4x Bloodstained Mire
2x Blue Fetches (1 Scalding Tarn / 1 Misty Rainforest)
2x Watery Grave
2x Blood Crypt
1x Steam Vents
1x Island
1x Swamp
```

### Creatures:





### Disruption Spells:
Being a tempo deck, it's important to have a variety of cheap and effective disruption spells. These spells can be used to either 1) progress your game plan and 2) hinder your opponent's game plan.

- Discard: It's standard to play 4x Thoughtsieze and 2x Inquisition of Kozilek. The life loss and ability to remove any nonland card from your opponent makes Thoughtsieze the better choice. 
	- Thoughtsieze: Thoughtsieze is a powerhouse of a card in this deck. It's a  
	- Inquisition of Kozilek:


- Counter: Discard spells allow you to slow down your opponent's game plan and have a good amount of information moving forward. However, since GDS decks typically play 8 threats, we need them to both resolve and survive. 
	- Stubborn Denial: Its cheap mana cost and Ferocious ability makes Stubborn Denial the go-to counter spell for GDS. Stubborn Denial protects your threats from non creatures spells for one blue mana. While this is a soft counter, opponents can pay one to negate the counter, it becomes a hard counter if you control a creature with power 4 or greater. This isn't particularly difficult for a deck with cheap beefy creatures.  Most lists play 4 Stubborn Denial (all in the mainboard or a 3/1 split). 

- Removal: Since your threats don't have any evasion (or pseudo-evasion) abilities on their own, it's vital to remove any potential blockers that can get in the way. 
	- Dismember: Dismember is a strong removal spell for several reasons. 1) It almost always a "Destroy Target Creature" and can remove indestructible creatures like Clothes, God of Destiny. 2) The Phyrexian mana cost effectively reduces the casting cost of this spell to one mana by losing four life. This downside can be effective in growing your Death's Shadow rather quickly. However, paying four life per removal spell can be punishing if you plan to play multiple. Therefore, most lists play two copies. 
	- Fatal Push / Lightning Bolt: Most pilots play a full set of Fatal Push or some combination of Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt. This is typically meta-dependent. Lightning Bolt is a nice way to finish off your opponent.

An interesting card to consider is Drown in the Loch. For UB, you can either counter target spell or destroy target creature with CMC less than or equal to the number of cards in your opponent's graveyard. This can act as both a counter/removal spell. In a fetchland-heavy format your opponent is typically filling their graveyard. Discard spells also help in this regard. One obvious downside to Drown is the it costs 2, which can be quite rough for tempo decks. 

### Cantrips:
Tempo decks are difficult to pilot because you need the right answer at the right time.   Drawing cards can allow you to dig for answers but it's almost always important that your cantrips do more than just draw a card and that the extra effect is beneficial for the player. It's hard to find a list that doesn't play a full set of Thought Scour and Mishra's Bauble. 

- Thought Scour acts as a pseudo-Dark Ritual for Gurmag Angler and can also provide Snapcaster Mage (and to some extent Kolaghan's Command) with targets. Being a blue instant is also an added benefit. 

- Mishra's Bauble is not only a free way to redraw and put a card in the graveyard but it can also provide you with library manipulation. If you have a Street Wraith or fetchland, players often "Bauble themselves" and draw that card with Street Wraith or shuffle it away with a fetchland. However, if you play a Thoughtsieze or IoK, it may be better to Bauble your opponent to have the most information available for your next turn.  

Serum Visions is probably the next best cantrip as it allows you to draw a card and scry 2 for library manipulation. 

### Current Deck List
Below is the current decklist that I am running:

```
Lands: 
4x Polluted Delta
4x Bloodstained Mire
2x Blue Fetches (1 Scalding Tarn / 1 Misty Rainforest)
2x Watery Grave
2x Blood Crypt
1x Steam Vents
1x Island
1x Swamp

Creatures:
4x Death's Shadow
4x Street Wraith
4x Gurmag Angler
2x Snapcaster Mage
1x Scourge of the Skyclaves

Disruption:
4x Thoughtsieze
2x Inquisition of Kozilek
4x Fatal Push
2x Dismember
3x Stubborn Denial
1x Drown in the Loch

Other:
2x Temur Battle Rage
```


#### My Hot Takes
- Cling to Dust as my "cantrips". Usually cantrips should do more than just draw a card. In a vacuum, Serum Visions is the next best cantrip for us as it allows for library manipulation. However, in a world of Uro, Mystic Sanctuary, and aggressive red decks, being able to exile a creature (e.g. Uro) and gain 3 life or exile a noncreature (e.g. Path to Exile) and draw a card shouldn't be overlooked. 
- Scourge > Snap. I replaced one Stubborn Denial with a Drown in the Loch for its versatility as both a removal and counter spell. Having access to both blue and black mana is almost never an issue and due to fetch lands and our discard spells, it's easy to stock up our opponents graveyard. Costing 2 can be quite rough, especially for a tempo deck.
